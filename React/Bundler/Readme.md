Before Starting any react Project first we have to Install all the Dependencies
1. Bundler i.e parcel || widos etc.
2. React
3. React-Dom


Steps are 
Open terminal
1. npm init
2.npm install parcel
3.npm install react
4.npm install React-dom

we got an particular Package.json & Packagelock.json file into our folder 
When Pushing this file to github always delete the node modules folder
